 Recommendation:

    The lowest sales performing was June ($509K), I recommend tranings to the sales reps and also to create awareness in the market for those products that are not moving.
     I recommend Sisi June should be given incentive to buy more and more encourage the other customer by giving promotional and creating awareness of the product.
    The top city performing should be expend and deploy more product to sell, attention should be given to the low sales city by interchanging the sales manager for better result.
    Higher opportunity and bonus should be given to the best manager of the year to encourage him to do more, also enroll the sales manager that did poor for training to catch up.

 Overall, this dashboard successfully provides a high-level overview of company performance across various dimensions such as time, region, product, and individual performance. This kind of analysis is crucial for strategic decision-making and performance optimization. Itâ€™s great to see my progress in data analytics and dashboard creation as part of my journey at Vephla University.
